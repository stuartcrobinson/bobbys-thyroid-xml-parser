you there
Bobby Madamanchi - 10:57 AM
hey
Stuart Robinson - 10:57 AM
emailed test file, does this format look okay?
alphabetized column names
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:01 AM
so each row is a new patient
thats great
i hope that did not take you all night
Stuart Robinson - 11:03 AM
20 minutes last night, hour this morning
it's running now, will take a few minutes
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:03 AM
oh ok great thanks
saved a ton of time on my end
Stuart Robinson - 11:04 AM
yeah one line per patient
oh i like doing this stuff. good practice, and a nice break from the stocks stuff.
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:05 AM
so are you backtesting for 3 hours still?
i mean 5years?
Stuart Robinson - 11:05 AM
oh no
forward testing now
set up interactivebrokers.com account
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:05 AM
ok
Stuart Robinson - 11:06 AM
they let you set up fake money account
so they simulate market for me
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:12 AM
hey
um
i need to have the ID in the row
i just noticed that
Stuart Robinson - 11:13 AM
patientID?
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:13 AM
its the TCGA-###-####
Stuart Robinson - 11:13 AM
oh, in the filename
?
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:13 AM
yeah
it should also be somewhere within thefile
as well
Stuart Robinson - 11:13 AM
hmm
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:13 AM
but but just pulling fromthe filename would befine too
Stuart Robinson - 11:14 AM
oh fuck i see what i did
okay
it missed values containing weird characters like "-" and maybe "." hold on
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:15 AM
yeah these things are so badly curated
and this is both the thyroid file and skin file together?
they ahve the same headings?
Stuart Robinson - 11:16 AM
yeah they're all dumped together
do you need separate files?
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:16 AM
no
Stuart Robinson - 11:21 AM
did you see email?
any idea why my program would have skipped like 40+ patients?
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:22 AM
with this stuff its possible they were duplicates
or they were empty
i cant believe how badly the stuff is done
810 is closer to what i was expecting
497+306 is what i have sequencing data for anyway
so if that is within these 810, thats great
Stuart Robinson - 11:26 AM
ok it's re-running, have to shower
Bobby Madamanchi - 11:29 AM
alright, thanks again
